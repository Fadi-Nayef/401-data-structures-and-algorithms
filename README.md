# *Tests*

*prove the following functionality:*

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
